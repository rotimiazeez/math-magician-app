# Math Magician App

"Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

- Make simple calculations.
- Read a random math-related quote.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node and NPM
- Web browser (Google chrome)
- Code Editor (VSCode)

### Development (Running locally)

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rotimiazeez/my-leaderboard.git

```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

To run StyleLint by itself, you may run the lint task:

```bash
npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
```

Or to automatically fix issues found (where possible):

```bash
npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}" --fix
```

You can also check against Webhint:

```bash
npx hint --telemetry=off .
```
